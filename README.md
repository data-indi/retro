# INDI Retrospective Studies

Curated, ready-to-use subsets of **INDI (International Neuroimaging Data-sharing Initiative)** *retrospective* releases, prepared for the **Pittsburgh Fiber Data Hub**. This repository consolidates links, essential metadata, licensing, and selected derived artifacts (e.g., QC tables, tractography-ready files) to streamline reuse and replication.

> **Access note:** Many datasets are hosted on external portals or S3 (e.g., NITRC, fcp-indi). Always review each dataset’s license and acknowledgments before use.

## MPI-Leipzig Mind-Brain-Body (LEMON & N&C)

**Dataset:** MPI-Leipzig Mind-Brain-Body (LEMON + Neuroanatomy & Connectivity)
**Participants:** **318** total

Data are organized into two protocols:

### LEMON (ses-01) — Structural & qT1 focus

* **Participants:** 228
* **Imaging:**

  * Quantitative T1-weighted (MP2RAGE; n≈227)
  * T2-weighted (225)
  * DWI (60 directions; 228)
  * 15-min eyes-open resting-state fMRI (227), with geometric distortion correction for DWI / rs-fMRI
  * 2D FLAIR (111, earlier part) → later replaced by high-res 3D FLAIR (SPACE) with FLAIR prep (116)
  * SWI sequence updated to an **in-house SWI** allowing magnitude + phase and **QSM**

### Neuroanatomy & Connectivity (N&C, ses-02) — Resting-state focus

* **Participants:** 199 (109 overlapping with LEMON)
* **Imaging:**

  * Four × 15-min eyes-open rs-fMRI runs (complete for 194; some with 1–3 runs)
  * T1-weighted + low-res FLAIR for unique N&C-only participants
  * Note: A multiband sequence bug caused **TE = 39.4 ms** for N&C rs-fMRI (vs **30 ms** in LEMON)

### Deep phenotyping & physiology

* Extensive cognitive, personality, and emotion questionnaires
* Behavioral tasks (e.g., CVLT, TAP, TMT, WST, LPS-2, RWT, etc.)
* Physiological measures: resting-state EEG, ECG, pulse, respiration, beat-to-beat blood pressure, anthropometry, blood / hair samples
* Clinical screening (SCID-I, HAM-D, BSL-23, AUDIT, etc.)

**Complete imaging subset:** 45 participants have full LEMON+N&C multimodal data (qT1, T2, 3D FLAIR, DWI, SWI/QSM, **75 min** rs-fMRI, field maps).

**Included assets (this repo, when present):**

* `mpi-lemon.dti.dz`, `mpi-lemon.gqi.dz`
* `participants.tsv`, `qc.tsv`
* Subject-level `*_dwi.*.fz`, `*_dwi.sz`, and structural NIfTIs

* T1-weighted MPRAGE (defaced)
* 64-direction DTI (2 mm isotropic)
* Demographic information, including EO/EC counterbalancing

**Use cases:**

* State-dependent changes in resting-state networks (EO vs EC)
* Test–retest reliability across runs with varying visual conditions
* Combined structure–function connectivity using DTI + rs-fMRI

## Known overlaps / deduplication

* **BNU Enhanced ↔ Beijing_Zang (FCP Classic):** participant overlap exists; perform **subject-level deduplication** before pooling.
* **SIMON:** multiple scanners and sites, but **same individual**; sessions must be treated as repeated measures, not independent subjects.
* **MPI-Leipzig LEMON vs N&C:** 109 participants overlap; account for **protocol/session** when modeling.

---

## Disclaimer

* All data originate from **independent sites** and are redistributed **as-is**.
* Acquisition parameters, scanner models, and instructions (eyes open/closed, fixation, etc.) differ across datasets.
* Users are responsible for:

  * Performing adequate **quality control** (motion, artifacts, protocol differences).
  * Choosing preprocessing pipelines suitable for **multiband**, **QSM**, and **TE differences** (e.g., LEMON vs N&C).
  * Complying with all **data use agreements** and **licensing terms**.
