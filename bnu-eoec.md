### **Project Overview**

This dataset includes data from **48 healthy control participants** recruited from the student population at **Beijing Normal University, China**. Each participant underwent **three resting-state fMRI scans** and a **64-direction diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scan**.

During the first resting-state fMRI scan, participants rested with their **eyes closed**. For the second and third scans, the condition was randomized between **eyes open** and **eyes closed** to investigate the effects of visual state on resting-state brain activity.

### **Available Data for Each Participant**

* **Three 6-minute resting-state fMRI (R-fMRI) scans**

  * First scan: Eyes closed
  * Second and third scans: Randomized between eyes open and eyes closed
* **MPRAGE anatomical scan** (defaced for confidentiality)
* **64-direction DTI scan** (2 mm isotropic resolution)
* **Demographic information**, including details on the counterbalancing of eyes open vs. eyes closed conditions
