### **Project Overview**

This dataset includes data from **180 healthy control participants** recruited from the community (student) population at **Beijing Normal University, China**. Compared to the earlier **Beijing\_Zang dataset** from the 1000 Functional Connectomes Classic collection, this release features:

* **IQ scores** (Verbal, Performance, and Full IQ from the Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale Revised) for a subset of participants (**n = 55**).
* **64-direction DTI scans** for all participants.

---

### **Available Data for Each Participant**

* **8-minute resting-state fMRI (R-fMRI) scan**
* **MPRAGE anatomical scan** (defaced for patient confidentiality)
* **64-direction DTI scan**
* **Demographic information**
* **IQ scores** (Verbal, Performance, and Full IQ available for 55 participants)

### **Important Notice**

Some participants in this release also appear in the **Beijing\_Zang dataset** from the 1000 Functional Connectomes Classic collection.
**Do not combine this dataset with the Beijing\_Zang dataset** to avoid duplication errors.
